This is a simple example of using the TESCO API to see their grocery store.
You can find details about the API at http://www.techfortesco.com/forum/ and 
register for the API at https://secure.techfortesco.com/tescoapiweb/

Once you have an account you need both a developer key PLUS 
an application key to login to the API

This simple example will let you search for a product list, and is slow. Takes
search string, sends login and then passes in search and displays results as
JSON data.

A better example would separate out JSON results into more readable info and 
let you follow up with details about single item.
